Drivers for NXPS32K144 (EECS 461 UMich)

These drivers were written as part of the course EECS461 Embedded Control Systems at University of Michigan. The files contain functions
previously defined by the instructors and functions added by me.

A Quadrature Decoder and a wheel is also part of the experimental setup.
